- did you make any unexpected design choices?
- what was difficult to model in Alloy?
- what properties did you focus on verifying? why are they important? what properties could you *not* verify?
- ...etc.

It is not a report, or an essay, or anything like that. Think of it as writing extended comments so that I don't have to wade into your Alloy model blindly.
